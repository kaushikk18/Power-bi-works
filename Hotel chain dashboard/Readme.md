## HOTEL CHAIN DASHBOARD

A Powerbi project which I decided to do with the data of Attliq hotel chain. The aim is to give insights on the the revenue and booking data of the hotel chain.

Collected the raw data from 5 different CSV files and loaded them into the power query editor and cleaned them.

While cleaning the data in the power query editor I learned that not every data available is important and we can remove the data/fields which doesn't provide any values after confirming it.

I made two different dashboards, one is for the 'Revenue Report' and the other one is 'Booking Report'.

The revenue report is for analyzing the revenue report of the company, about how much profit/revenue every hotel/property/city genrated in a specific period of time.

The Performance report shows the booking performance of the hotels such as Cancellation percentage, Occupancy percentage, stc.

By creating meaningful measures, I was able to create good dashboard which would actually help the management.
